<p align="center">
This project represents a milestone in the C code curriculum at ALX Africa Software Engineering, focusing on the implementation of a shell. </br>Referred to as the "Gates of Shell," this project is a part of the first trimester and serves as a valuable learning experience for students to delve into advanced concepts such as processes, system calls, bit manipulation, file management, and error handling. </br>The shell created in this project mimics the functionalities of a basic UNIX command interpreter (sh).</br> The entire program has been crafted using the C programming language.

 ## Description :
This is a shell written in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).
It is based on [the Thompson Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_shell).

## Environment :

the shell was built and tested on  Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

## Features
* Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
* If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
* Handle errors.
* Hndling the ‚Äúend of file‚Äù condition (Ctrl+D)
* Hanling the command line with arguments
* Handle the PATH
* Support the exit features


## Builtins

 ## Installation : Getting HSH
 
Clone the below repository and compile the files into an executable using the GCC compiler.
```
https://github.com/noble-ch/simple_shell.git
```

### Basic usage :bulb:
- First, Fork this Repository [Learn how to fork repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).
- Then Clone [Learn how to clone ](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
- Create an executable by running the following command:
- `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh`
- From there, type in the following command and press your enter button.
- `./hsh`
- Final step: ENJOY!


## Example :computer:
```
ls -la
